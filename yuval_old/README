while starting again work on this project I realize that there
is code in some folders that I don't use anymore. It confussed me
because I thought I cleaned up everything before I did the last commit
in the thesis repository. But apparently not. Maybe because in the end
I did not work on the nonevoked syns folder anymore, this was done in
the beginning. So all the files which are not used currently are moved
to this "yuval_old" folder
